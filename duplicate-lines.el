;;; Commentary:
;; Provides a function that duplicates current line or region.
;; If the active region doesn't start at the beginning of the line or
;; doesn't end at the end of the line, it will be expanded.
;; After duplicate, it will keep the selection of duplicated region.
;; Basically, the behaviour should be similar to Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

;;; Code:

(defun line-start-p (p)
  (goto-char p)
