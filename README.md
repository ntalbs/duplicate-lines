# duplicate-lines
Duplicate the current line or selected region. This package mimics the behaviour of duplicate lines in Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

* Active mark will be expanded to incompass the whole lines of mark and point.
* If there's no active mark, it will select the current line.
* Keep selection after duplication.
