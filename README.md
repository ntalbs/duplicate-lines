# duplicate-lines
Duplicate current line &amp; selection.

This package mimics the behaviour of duplicate lines in Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

Inspired by [duplicate-thing](https://github.com/ongaeshi/duplicate-thing) but the functionality improved to be more similar to that of Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

* Active mark will be expanded to incompass the whole lines of mark and point.
* If there's no active mark, it will select the current line.
* Keep selection after duplication.
